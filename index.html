	<h3>Rodents in Schools?</h3>		
				<p>
				473 rodent-related violations were recorded throughout 2023. Roaches were also found across New York City school cafeterias, with 81 such violations reported in 2023, according to the same data.
				</p>

				<p>
				Last Fall, Mayor Eric Adams signed the <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/View.ashx?M=F&ID=11533762&GUID=C106E5E9-FB61-4237-B5F8-5A1D080E868D"> “rat action plan"</a> into law, officially launching the city’s  “war on rats,” which aims to reduce the rodent population across New York City. The anti-rodent policy included new rules mandating restaurants and businesses to put their trash in sealed bins instead of leaving trash bags out on their storefront. <a href="https://rules.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Ch.-35_NOA_Rat-Mitigation-Zones_6-7-23-1.pdf"> Rat mitigation zones</a> were also designated as areas where the anti-rodent efforts would be prioritized.

		<h3>Methodology</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-School-Cafeteria-Inspections-2020-Present-/5ery-qagt">The dataset </a> covers results between 2020-2023 from Department of Health & Mental Hygiene Inspections of New York City school cafeteria and looks at a variety of health code violations. 
			</p>

			<p>
				This data was analyzed by creating a pivot table to identify the most common violation types and where they occurred. Upon analyzing the pivot table results, it was determined that the most common violations are 10F, 08A, and 04L. 08A violations refer to an establishment that “is not free of harborage or conditions conducive to rodents, insects or other pests.” 04L violations refer to “evidence of mice or live mice in food or non-food areas.” 10F violations refer to “Non-food contact surface or equipment made of unacceptable material, not kept clean, or not properly sealed, raised, spaced or movable to allow accessibility for cleaning on all sides, above and underneath the unit.” All as defined by the <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/5ery-qagt/files/0c087949-1144-4dfd-abe9-e494a642bf77?download=true&filename=School_cafeteria_data_dictionary_FINAL__9.23.2020_.xlsx"> data dictionary. </a> The spreadsheet with my cleaned data used for analysis can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O2jdHBa1-OEySpiUACX_4g-FhMNaGfs2S0it7SB56_A/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a>
