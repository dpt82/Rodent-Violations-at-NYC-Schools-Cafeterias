						Methodology:
						</p>
						</h2> 

						<p> To be Updated. </p>
						

					<!-- 	<p> The chart above, refers to violations of article 47, subsection 41(j) of the New York City Health Code, which refers to maintenance issues such as missing or stained ceiling tiles that indicate water leaks, or signs of mold found on walls or finishes, or missing or broken floor tiles. These violations date from 2020-2023 with only 10 having occurred outside of 2023.</p>

						<p>To clean and analyze this data, the first step was finding a particular health code violation to focus on. After deciding on 47.41(j), it was time to clean and analyze the data; this involved finding duplicate entries, selecting: 'data, data cleanup, remove duplicates.' After this, it was time to determine why these violations mattered. This next step involved reviewing the 'violation status' column of the dataset and filtering out the locations where violations were marked as 'corrected.' The locations with violations marked as 'open' became the focus. Then, locations with open violations were compared with locations that were required to undergo follow-up inspections and locations that weren't. After this assessment, the data was combined, further analyzed and a pivot table was created. This pivot table determined that the Bronx had the highest number of 47.41(j) violations. </p>

						<p>	This determination was double checked using a formula which can be found in the links included at the end of this article. To confirm the accuracy of the formula and to ensure an accurate comparison, the child care violations were then compared by population per borough. </p>

						<p> The per-capita comparison was done outside of google sheets, but the pivot table is marked clearly: pivot table. The formulas used can be found at the bottom of the 'Opened_Required' and 'Open NotRequired' sheets of the spreadsheet. The formulas show Bronx had the highest number of open violations with required follow-up inspections, but Queens had the highest number of open violations that were not required to undergo follow-up inspections. </p> -->
