Data story regarding rodent violations in NYC School Cafeterias. Story was crafted using inspection data from the department of Health and Mental Hygiene


The dataset covers results between 2020-2023 from Department of Health & Mental Hygiene Inspections of New York City school cafeteria and looks at a variety of health code violations. Linked Here:

This data was analyzed by creating a pivot table to identify the most common violation types and where they occurred. Upon analyzing the pivot table results, it was determined that the most common violations are 10F, 08A, and 04L. 

08A violations refer to an establishment that “is not free of harborage or conditions conducive to rodents, insects or other pests.” 04L violations refer to “evidence of mice or live mice in food or non-food areas.” 10F violations refer to “Non-food contact surface or equipment made of unacceptable material, not kept clean, or not properly sealed, raised, spaced or movable to allow accessibility for cleaning on all sides, above and underneath the unit.” All as defined by the data dictionary.
